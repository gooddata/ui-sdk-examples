/**
 * Creates and configures an instance of Analytical Backend to use in the application. This can be a delicate
 * matter especially in development mode - considering that CORS and OIDC authentication MAY be needed. The
 * configuration is as follows:
 *
 * In production build:
 *
 * -  Backend is always set to use Tiger's OIDC authentication flow. As soon as a NotAuthenticated error
 *    is encountered, the app will redirect to page where the flow starts
 *
 * -  If the `REACT_APP_SET_HOSTNAME` env variable IS set, then Analytical Backend will be configured to
 *    talk with server running at location specified in constants.js / backend property. This MAY lead to
 *    cross-origin requests if the application is served from different origin.
 *
 * -  If the `REACT_APP_SET_HOSTNAME` env variable IS NOT, then the Analytical Backend will assume it
 *    Tiger is running on the same origin.
 *
 * In development build:
 *
 * -  There is a proxy set up and running inside the webpack dev server. All `/api` endpoints are
 *    proxied to the Tiger instance running at location specified in constants.js / backend property.
 *
 * -  If `REACT_APP_SET_HOSTNAME` env variable IS NOT set and the `REACT_APP_DEV_TIGER_API_TOKEN` env variable IS set,
 *    then the backend will be configured to use the local proxy and will use the token set in the
 *    `REACT_APP_DEV_TIGER_API_TOKEN` env variable.
 *
 *    ^^^ This is the setup of choice if your Tiger installation is not set up with HTTPS and CORS headers. Please
 *    consult documentation to learn how to obtain the authentication token.
 *
 * -  In all other cases, the Analytical Backend will be configured to communicate with Tiger servers running
 *    at location specified in constants.js / backend property AND use the OIDC authentication flow.
 *
